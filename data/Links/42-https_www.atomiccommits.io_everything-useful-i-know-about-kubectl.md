# Everything Useful I Know About kubectl

* * *

Ok, mostly everything.

Also check out the [official kubectl cheatsheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/). This [community cheat sheet](https://github.com/dennyzhang/cheatsheet-kubernetes-A4) is also very thorough.

I’m going to put a ⭐ next to things I’ve found that are less common. A lot of this is already well documented.

### Quick Note on Aliasing `k`

Before we start, I recommend adding the following snippet to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`. Writing `k` instead of `kubectl` is nice, and you want autocompletion.
    
    
    alias k="kubectl"
    complete -F __start_kubectl k
    

## Get Help

`kubectl` is self-documenting, which is another reason why it’s 100x better than a UI. If you’re confused about some command, just do `k <command> --help`. e.g. `k label --help`. There will be lots of examples in the help docs.

## Minimize the use of imperative commands

There are many commands, like `create`, `expose`, `scale`, `set image`, `rollout`, etc. that I don’t use that much.

That’s because it’s better to deal with your Kubernetes configuration declaratively, and have a CI/CD system run the equivalent of `kubectl apply -f .`.

You should learn how to use these commands, but they shouldn’t be a regular part of your prod workflows. That will lead to a flaky system.

  


# Basic Getting of Details

You can `k get` any Kubernetes API Resource.
    
    
    $ k get pods
    $ k get nodes
    $ k get services
    
    # You can sort too
    $ k get pods --sort-by=.status.startTime
    
    # Get with a label selector
    $ k get pods -l app=kombucha-service
    
    # Watch over time
    $ k get pods -l app=kombucha-service --watch
    
    # View the events
    $ k get events
    
    # Describe the pod
    $ k describe pod <pod-name>
    

Describing the pod can help you figure out why it crashed. Perhaps you’re trying to inject a config map that doesn’t exist into its environment.

Furthermore, they often have abbreviations. To see what resources you can get and their abbreviations, use the `api-resources` command. This is helpful as well with custom resources.
    
    
    $ k api-resources
    NAME                              SHORTNAMES          APIGROUP                       NAMESPACED   KIND
    bindings                                                                             true         Binding
    componentstatuses                 cs                                                 false        ComponentStatus
    configmaps                        cm                                                 true         ConfigMap
    endpoints                         ep                                                 true         Endpoints
    events                            ev                                                 true         Event
    limitranges                       limits                                             true         LimitRange
    .
    .
    .
    csidrivers                                            storage.k8s.io                 false        CSIDriver
    csinodes                                              storage.k8s.io                 false        CSINode
    storageclasses                    sc                  storage.k8s.io                 false        StorageClass
    volumeattachments                                     storage.k8s.io                 false        VolumeAttachment
    

If you’re unsure what some resource is, use `k explain`.
    
    
    $ k explain deployment
    KIND:     Deployment
    VERSION:  apps/v1
    
    DESCRIPTION:
         Deployment enables declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.
    
    FIELDS:
       apiVersion	<string>
         APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an
         object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal
         value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info:
         <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources>
    
       kind	<string>
         Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object
         represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits
         requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info:
         <https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds>
    
       metadata	<Object>
         Standard object metadata.
    
       spec	<Object>
         Specification of the desired behavior of the Deployment.
    
       status	<Object>
         Most recently observed status of the Deployment.
    

  


# Troubleshooting

### Getting Logs
    
    
    # Follow the logs of a pod
    $ k logs -f <pod-name> -c <container-name>
    
    # For only the tail, use `--tail=n`
    $ k logs <pod-name> -c <container-name> --tail=50
    
    # Multiple pods at once
    $ k logs -l foo=bar
    

### ⭐ Debugging DNS and Services

This first tip _is_ in the [Debugging DNS Resolution](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-debugging-resolution/) article in the docs, but here is a quick imperative command to get the same result.
    
    
    # Run a pod with DNS debugging utilities
    $ k run dnsutils --image=gcr.io/kubernetes-e2e-test-images/dnsutils:1.3 -- sleep 3600
    
    # Run DNS commands from that pod
    $ k exec -it dnsutils -- nslookup kubernetes.default
    Server:		10.11.0.10
    Address:	10.11.0.10#53
    
    Name:	kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local
    Address: 10.11.0.1
    

If you’re wondering if you created a service correctly, you should also look into `k get endpoints`, and also double check the label selector. e.g.
    
    
    $ k get svc alex-echo -o wide
    NAME        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE    SELECTOR
    alex-echo   ClusterIP   10.11.101.85   <none>        80/TCP    161d   app=alex-echo-server
    
    $ k get pods -l app=alex-echo-server
    NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    alex-echo-server-7c47c5698c-zfhwg   1/1     Running   0          20h
    

### What image is the pod running?
    
    
    # What image is the pod running?
    $ k get pod dnsutils -o jsonpath='{ .spec.containers[*].image }'
    gcr.io/kubernetes-e2e-test-images/dnsutils:1.3
    

### Decode and Copy a Secret
    
    
    # Decode and copy a secret
    $ k get secrets <secret-name> -o jsonpath='{ .data.<key> }' | base64 --decode | pbcopy
    

### Metrics / Monitoring
    
    
    # Is something hogging resources?
    $ k top pods --all-namespaces --sort-by=memory
    $ k top pods --all-namespaces --sort-by=cpu
    $ k top nodes --sort-by=memory
    $ k top nodes --sort-by=cpu
    

For more you can do with metrics, see [here](https://github.com/yokawasa/kubectl-tips#get-kubernetes-raw-metrics---prometheus-metrics-endpoint).

### Executing commands on pods or nodes
    
    
    # Execute a command on a pod
    $ k exec -it nginx -- echo 'hello'
    hello
    
    # start a shell session
    $ k exec -it nginx -- /bin/bash
    [[email protected]](https://www.atomiccommits.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection):/# echo hi!
    hi!
    
    # Starting a shell on a node is trickier
    # I use the kubectl-node-shell (<https://github.com/kvaps/kubectl-node-shell>)
    $ k node-shell <node> -- echo 123
    

Once you’ve started a shell session on a pod or node, `curl`, `nslookup`, `ping`, and `env` are useful.

### What is the pod’s IP?
    
    
    $ k get pod nginx -o=jsonpath='{ .status.podIPs[0].ip }'
    10.11.151.203
    

### Validate Kubernetes Resources

I’ve seen a lot of time wasted from people struggling to write YAML.
    
    
    # Lint a Helm chart
    # Good to put in pre-merge checks
    $ helm template . | kubeval -
    
    # Or just on a file
    $ kubeval pod.yaml
    

  


# Making Changes

Recall my note on not abusing the imperative commands. I’m serious about that.

### Scale a `Deployment` or `StatefulSet`
    
    
    $ k scale --replicas=n statefulset/<stateful-set-name>
    $ k scale --replicas=n deployment/<deployment-name>
    

### Restarting / Deleting Workflows

If a pod is not owned by a `Deployment` (really, a `ReplicaSet`), it will not come back after you delete it.
    
    
    # Deleting pods owned by a deployment is safe — they will restart
    $ k delete pod <deployment-pod-a>
    
    # Same thing for Stateful Set pods
    $ k delete pod <stateful-set-pod-0>
    
    # Trigger a CronJob
    $ k create job --from=cronjob/hello-world hello-world-now
    
    # Now I want to clean up all my nginx pods that i've used for debugging
    $ kubectl get pods -o custom-columns='NAME:metadata.name' --no-headers | grep nginx | xargs
    nginx-alex nginx-bobby-cox nginx-freddie-freeman nginx-ozzie-albies nginx-ronald-acuna
    
    # Use that now as a sub-command
    $ k delete pod $(kubectl get pods -o custom-columns='NAME:metadata.name' --no-headers | grep nginx | xargs) --dry-run=client
    pod "nginx-alex" deleted (dry run)
    pod "nginx-bobby-cox" deleted (dry run)
    pod "nginx-freddie-freeman" deleted (dry run)
    pod "nginx-ozzie-albies" deleted (dry run)
    pod "nginx-ronald-acuna" deleted (dry run)
    

### Quickly Generate YAML

You can quickly generate a starting point for resource files with an imperative command + `-dry-run=client -o yaml`.
    
    
    $ k run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        run: nginx
      name: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        resources: {}
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      restartPolicy: Always
    status: {}
    
    # or to go straight to a file
    $ k run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml >> pod.yaml
    

This helped a lot on the CKA exam, because you basically just have `kubectl` and `vim`, as well as the Kubernetes docs. And there is definitely time pressure.

### ⭐ Run an echo server
    
    
    $ k run echo-server --image=ealen/echo-server
    pod/echo-server created
    
    $ k port-forward echo-server :80
    Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:60882 -> 80
    Forwarding from [::1]:60882 -> 80
    Handling connection for 60882
    
    # Now I can hit that app locally
    $ curl <http://localhost:60882> | jq .
    {
      "host": {
        "hostname": "localhost",
        "ip": "::ffff:127.0.0.1",
        "ips": []
      },
      "http": {
        "method": "GET",
        "baseUrl": "",
        "originalUrl": "/",
        "protocol": "http"
      },
      "request": {
        "params": {
          "0": "/"
        },
        "query": {},
        "cookies": {},
        "body": {},
        "headers": {
          "host": "localhost:60882",
          "user-agent": "curl/7.65.3",
          "accept": "*/*"
        }
      },
      "environment": {} # hiding this output
    }
    

  


# Plugins

Note - install any of these with `krew`.
    
    
    $ kubectl krew install ctx
    $ kubectl krew install ns
    

Kubectl has some awesome plugins. For example, I hate typing
    
    
    $ k config use-context <context-name>
    

so I use the [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx#kubectl-plugins-macos-and-linux) plugin. And I do
    
    
    $ k ctx <context-name>
    

Super helpful. I also like

  * [kubens](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) \- Same as kubectx, but for namespaces.
  * ⭐ [ksniff](https://github.com/eldadru/ksniff) \- Use tcpdump and Wireshark to start a remote capture on any pod. This is gold for debugging socket hangups.
  * [kubectl-node-shell](https://github.com/kvaps/kubectl-node-shell) \- Run a shell on a Kubernetes node. Note that there are a lot of privileged things you won’t be able to do. For that you have to use the plugin to run a privileged container.
  * [kubecolor](https://github.com/dty1er/kubecolor) \- I like having colorized output. I just make the `alias k=kubecolor` in my `.zshrc` to use this instead.



### Additional Thoughts

  * To check user privileges, look into `k auth can-i`.
  * You can see all CRDs with `k get crds`.



## Final Note on kubectl Training

This past spring I passed the Certified Kubernetes Administrator exam.

While we can debate the merits of the certification industry, the CKA can be looked at as a kubectl video game. It’s a lot fun. If you don’t love exams but want the video game experience, [Killer Shell](https://killer.sh/) is a great challenge.
